# Currency Converter Web Application

---

For the currency converter task, I used a component-based architecture with React and React Query.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based approach. It allows you to break down the UI into reusable components, making the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

React Query is a powerful data-fetching library for React applications. It provides a simple and declarative API to manage data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server. It leverages the React component lifecycle and hooks system to handle data loading and state management efficiently.

The chosen architecture offers several advantages:

1. **Modularity**: With React's component-based architecture, the currency converter can be divided into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to reason about and maintain the codebase.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: React Query abstracts the data-fetching and caching logic, allowing the components to focus on rendering and interacting with the data. This separation improves code readability and maintainability.

3. **Efficient Data Management**: React Query's caching mechanism optimizes data fetching by storing and reusing the fetched data across components. It handles data synchronization and provides options for cache invalidation and refreshing, resulting in a more efficient application.

4. **Scalability**: The component-based architecture with React and React Query provides a solid foundation for scalability. As the project grows, additional components can be added, and more complex features can be implemented while maintaining separation of concerns and code modularity.

Overall, this architecture promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it a suitable choice for the currency converter task and other projects with similar requirements.
